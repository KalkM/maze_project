The goal of this project is to create a game in 3D using raycasting
0. Walls
The first part,
* Create a window with SDL2
* Use raycasting to draw walls on your window.
* You don’t need to be able to rotate the camera during the execution in this part, but you must provide a way to change the angle of the camera in your code to see if it works after recompiling it.
* The color of the walls must be different from the color of the ground/ceil.
* The map doesn’t need to be parsed from a file, but you must provide a way to modify it in your code to see if it works after recompiling it. (e.g. using an array of arrays of integers or characters)
1. Orientation
In this part,
* Draw walls facing NORTH and SOUTH in a different color from walls facing EAST and WEST.
2. Rotation
In this part,
* Rotate the camera when the left,right arrows are pressed on the keyboard. Or you can rotate the camera when the mouse moves, just like a FPS game.
3. Move
In this part, 
* You can move the camera when the w,a,s,d keys are pressed on the keyboard.
4. Ouch
In this part, 
* The player must not be able to enter walls.
* You can make the player slide on the walls instead of just stop it.
5. Parser
In this part, 
* Define the standards of your map (The character for a wall, the character for nothing, the extension of the file if you want, …)
* Add a parameter to run which will be the path to the map file
6. Draw the map
In this part, 
* Draw the map where you want, with the color you want, …
* Provide a way to enable/disable it during the execution
* Include the player’s line of sight in the map
7. Coding style + Documentation
In this part,
* Check if you code fits the Holberton School coding style.
* Check if your code is well documented and respect the Holberton School documentation 
8. Textures
In this part, 
* Add textures on your walls
9. Multi task
In this part,
* Add a way to move on several directions and rotate in the same time. Basically in this part you’ll have to handle multiple events on the same frame.
10. Ground textures
In this part, 
* Add textures on the ground and/or on the ceiling.
11. Weapons
In this part,
* Add weapons textures
12. Enemies
In this part,
* Add some enemies 
13. Make it rain
In this part,
* Add rain and a possibility to stop / start the rain with a key.
14. Extra option
In this part,
* Shadows, special lightning, etc… get creative!
